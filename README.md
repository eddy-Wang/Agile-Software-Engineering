Agile Software Engineering is an iterative and flexible approach to software development that prioritises collaboration, customer feedback, and incremental delivery of functional software. Unlike traditional methodologies like Waterfall (which follows a rigid, linear sequence of phases), Agile focuses on adaptability, continuous improvement, and delivering value to users early and often. 

Agile is guided by the Agile Manifesto which emphasises:
1.	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2.	Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3.	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4.	Responding to change over following a plan.
