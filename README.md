# Agile-Software-Engineering
Agile Software Engineering is an iterative and flexible approach to software development that prioritises collaboration, customer feedback, and incremental delivery of functional software. Unlike traditional methodologies like Waterfall (which follows a rigid, linear sequence of phases), Agile focuses on adaptability, continuous improvement, and delivering value to users early and often. 

Agile is guided by the Agile Manifesto which emphasises:
1.	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2.	Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3.	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4.	Responding to change over following a plan.
